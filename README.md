# pepperoni cooker software (pepperoniWare)
the [rainyware pepperoni cooker](https://rainyware.rainsounds2.com/projectpages-pepperonicooker/) is a very peak joose project involving cooking pepperonis inside of a 5.25" optical drive.
but then like how do you know when the pepperoni is done cooking? how long do you heat up the cooker before putting a pepperoni in it?

# the process
basically i timed how long it takes to cook a pepperoni and checking every 10 seconds then making a timer that's just a video that plays and then blasts the audio transmission at you.
it takes 4 minutes and 30 seconds. i know it's slow but im not trying to melt the inside of my computer by actually giving that thing 12 volts which will make it ~400 degrees instead of 160-180 on 5v

# preheating
like any oven, the pepperoni cooker will need to preheat before peppeoni cooking so it has that as well (it's also pretty slow but then again it's supposed to be inside of a computer, better safe then sorry). that's also done by a timer. there's not like a sensor or anything so it's what i could do.

also i made this on RPG maker MV so technically this is a video game all it does is play some videos and [i have a bit of experience with it](https://github.com/Nametag71/spis)
 so it was the best option so s
